1. Carriers of Goods  Placing of Cars  Understanding of Agent  Instructions  Railroads. Where damages are sought to be recovered for the omission or neglect by the carrier to place a refrigerator car for a shipment of lettuce at a certain place and time upon the request of the consignors agent, and the evidence tends to show that the request was made under such circumstances that the defendant's agent, exercising reasonable intelligence and care, may have misunderstood it, an instruction based upon the understanding of the order by the agent of the defendant is not objectionable on the plaintiffs appeal. 2. Carriers of Goods  Placing of Cars  RulesWaiverRailroads. The carrier is entitled to reasonable notice from the shipper for placing a car to be loaded, and when written notice is required by its rules, the rule may be waived or abandoned by a verbal agreement. 3. Instructions  Full or Explicit  Appeal and Error  Exceptions. Requests for special instructions should be tendered, and when not covered by the charge, in the absence of such request, an exception that the instruction given was not full and explicit will not ordinarily be held as error on appeal. 4. Instructions  Contentions  Appeal and Error  Objections and Exceptions. The appellant should have asked the trial judge, at the time, to state such of his contentions as he claims were omitted, and having failed to do so, his exceptions on that ground will not avail him in this Court on appeal.
