Liens  MaterialmenLaborersPrincipal and Surety  Contractors Bonds Municipal Buildings. The policy of our law with respect to mechanics and laborers liens upon buildings being built, etc., as evidenced by our statutes and decisions thereon, is to give protection to creditors of this class by remedying defects found in existing laws; and the Laws of 1913 and 1915, Gregorys Supplement to Pells Bevisal, sec. 2020-A. p. 2019, expressly provides for laborers and materialmen a right of action against the surety on the contractors bond for the erection of a municipal building, and any provision incorporated in bonds of this character that takes away this right are contrary to our public policy and the express provisions of our statute, ,, and void.
