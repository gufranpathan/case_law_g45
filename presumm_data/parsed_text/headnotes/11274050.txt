1. Statutes — Amendments—Effect. The effect of an amendment to a statute is to incorporate the old statute into the amendment with the same effect as if the amendment had been a part of the old statute when the latter was enacted. 2. Bigamy — Criminal Law — Statutes—Courts—Jurisdiction—Bigamous Cohabitation — Constitutional Law. The amendment to Rev., 3361, ch. 26, Public Laws 1913, making it a felony and punishable as in cases of bigamy, for a married person to marry again, in another State, which would have been bigamous if contracted here, and “thereafter cohabit with such person in this State,” does not attempt to confer extra territorial jurisdiction upon our own courts, the offense for which the person is tried, being one committed here. 3. Bigamy — Criminal Law — Statutes—Trials—Place Offense Was Committed —Venue—Bigamous Cohabitation. A plea in abatement upon the ground that Rev., 3361, as amended by ch. 26, Public Laws 1913, makes the offense of bigamy and not the offense of bigamous cohabitation triable in the county in which the offender should be apprehended, is bad.
