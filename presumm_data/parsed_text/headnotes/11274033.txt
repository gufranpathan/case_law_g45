Evidence — Character—Substantive—Criminal Law — Instructions—Appeal and Error — Harmless Error. Testimony as to tbe character of witnesses other than tbe parties to a criminal action may not be regarded as substantive evidence, but where a party, with other witnesses, have testified at the trial, the charge of the court will not be held for reversible error when it appears that in apparently instructing otherwise, he could only have been speaking with reference to those witnesses who were not parties. 3. Witnesses — Evidence—Children—Findings—Appeal and Error. The finding of the trial judge as to the competency of a witness to testify on account of his childhood is conclusive on appeal. 4. Appeal and Error — Objections and Exceptions — Evidence—Restrictions— Rules Supreme Court. Exceptions to evidence admitted generally for all purposes, on the ground that it should have been restricted, or that it was incompetent in part, should be based upon the refusal of the trial judge to a request thereto made at the time of its admission, or it will not be considered on appeal.
