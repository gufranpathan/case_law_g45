       " 'When it is admitted or the jury find that standard safety appliances are known, approved and in general use in respect to the particular character of machinery furnished, or upon which plaintiff is employed, the law imposes the duty upon the employer to furnish such appliances, this being the standard of duty.',\n",
       " 'When the evidence in this respect is conflicting, or the inference to be drawn from it doubtful, the question should be submitted to the jury, under proper instructions in regard to the standard of duty.',\n",

       " \"There was a verdict and judgment for 'defendant.\",\n",
       " 'Plaintiff noted exceptions to the charge and appealed.',\n",
       " 'The facts pertinent to the exceptions and the decision of the appeal are: Defendant company, in connection with its other business, made “dry cans,” which were used in woolen mills to dry yarn after it had been dyed.',\n",
       " 'It was necessary that they should be steam-tight in order that they could be filled with steam, and heat the surface so that yarns would dry.',\n",
       " 'They were cylindrical in shape, 6 or 7 feet long and from 1 foot to iy2 feet across the ends, with iron heads and bands shrunk around the heads.',\n",
       " 'The manner of testing the cans for leaks was as follows: The cans, after having the iron heads strongly fastened on by shrinking an iron band around them, were taken outdoors, near the boiler house, and a pipe connected with the boiler would carry steam into an opening at one end of the cans, this opening being half an inch in diameter.',\n",
       " 'On the pipe taking the steam into the can there was a steam cock to turn off the steam, the amount of steam passing through the pipe depending on how far this valve or cock was turned.',\n",
       " 'There was also on this pipe a steam gauge to indicate the amount of steam pressure passing through the pipe into the can.',\n",
       " 'In order to test the cans it was necessary to hold the pressure at from 10 to 15 pounds, the cans being capable of standing a pressure of 50 pounds.',\n",
       " 'After the steam had been let into the can, the can was struck with a hammer in the hands of the person whose business it was to see if there were any leaks, the stroke of the hammer being intended to indicate the leaks by the steam coming out.',\n",
       " 'At the opposite end of the can into which the steam came there was a pipe sticking out, with an outlet 1 inch in diameter, and at this end, to regulate the amount of steam pressure, the plaintiff was at work with a piece of scantling pressed against a stob in the ground, or the toe of his foot, as he chose; upon the scantling there was nailed a piece of leather, and at the point where the leather was nailed the scantling was pressed against the outlet.',\n",
       " 'It was his business to watch the steam gauge at the other end, which was some 6 or 8 feet from him, and, by turning the scantling from side to side, reduce or increase the pressure.',\n",
       " 'While at work, for some reason, the head blew out and the scantling struck the plaintiff-on the head.',\n",
       " 'Plaintiff alleged that defendant was negligent, in that it failed to provide a safety valve which was in general use by those performing this class of work, so that the steam would automatically escape beyond the pressure desired.',\n",
       " 'There was evidence tending to show that safety valves are in common use wherever any pressure is used in the form of steam or water; that they are used on everything that contains a pressure in order to make it safe.',\n",
       " 'It is very important to have a safety valve there when one would not know the condition of the steam gauge; it may be right or it may be wrong.',\n",
       " 'It is proper to use a safety valve on a machine when testing it.',\n",
       " 'One could not guarantee it unless a safety valve was on it.',\n",
       " 'It was not safe to test the cylinder with steam* without using a safety valve.',\n",
       " 'It is dangerous, for the simple reason that a steam gauge cannot be adjusted as quickly as steam will adjust itself.',\n",
       " 'Steam itself will find a way out of a boiler quicker than one can turn it out if the proper spring is waiting for it at the point to take action.',\n",
       " 'A steam gauge is no safety whatever on a boiler.',\n",
       " 'It simply gives you time to get away before it blows up!',\n",
       " 'A safety valve is simply to take care of you while around the boiler.',\n",
       " 'It is not safe for a man to stand at this end of this cylinder here and adjust it with a stick and tell by looking at that gauge what pressure of steam was in the cylinder, if he did that constantly.',\n",
       " 'A witness testified: “I understand tbe use of a safety valve.',\n",
       " 'It is used to carry a certain amount of pressure in tbe boiler and give number of pounds to tbe square inch.',\n",
       " 'It is set for tbe purpose required.',\n",
       " 'It works automatically.',\n",
       " 'When it gets to the given pounds of pressure it is set back and relieves tbe pressure itself.',\n",
       " 'If it is set for 10 pounds pressure and the pressure becomes more than 10 pounds, it blows off.',\n",
       " 'Safety valves are in general use in steam machinery or vessels charged with steam.',\n",
       " 'I do not remember ever seeing a boiler that did not have some kind of a safety valve on it.',\n",
       " \"If a safety valve bad been' on tbe can, set for 10 pounds, and more then 10 pounds came into the pipe leading to the can, it would have relieved itself.\",\n",
       " 'It is the general use to have safety valves on all vessels carrying steam.”\\nThere was evidence that safety valves corrode and fail to operate.',\n",
       " 'There was also evidence that the way provided for plaintiff to do the work assigned to him was safe; that the steam gauge indicated the amount of steam in the boiler.',\n",
       " 'There was no evidence of any defect in the material of which the boiler was constructed.',\n",
       " 'Defendant contended that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.',\n",
       " 'Both parties submitted a number of prayers for special instructions.',\n",
       " 'Among other instructions given by his Honor, he said to the jury that the duty of the employer was met if he furnished to bis employee reasonably safe appliances for his work, etc.',\n",
       " 'He further said: “If the gauge was a reasonably safe appliance, it does not make any difference that the defendant didn’t furnish a safety valve; but if it was not reasonably safe without a safety valve, then it would be negligence on the part of the defendant not to furnish a safety valve, provided that you should find that safety valves were in common use in work of this kind.” Plaintiff excepted.',\n",
       " '“When you come to consider the allegations of negligence directed at the fact that the defendant did not furnish a safety valve, I charge you that you cannot find that the defendant was negligent in this respect, from the fact alone that you may find that if it had been adopted it would have had a tendency to decrease the risk and make the work safer; but in order to find the defendant guilty of negligence on account of this allegation, you must find from the evidence that a safety valve was so manifestly serviceable and necessary as to command the adoption thereof by reasonably prudent men in the same business so generally that it could not reasonably be ignored or disregarded.” Plaintiff excepted.',\n",
