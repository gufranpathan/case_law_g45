       "'PRUE v. HIGHT.\\nHABEAS CORPUS.\\nA free infant of color, rightfully bound as an apprentice, remains subject to the jurisdiction of the County Court, wherein he was bound, until discharged in the mode provided, sec. 5, ch. 5, Revised Code.\\nA habeas COkpus was returned before bis Honor, Chief Justice PeaesoN, who invited the other Judges to assist at the argument.of the matter, and accordingly the case was heard in the room of the Supreme Court, by all the Judges, on 8th of January, 1859, and was as follows :\\nAlfred Prue, a free boy of color, an inhabitant of Franklin county, was bound by the County Court of that county, as an apprentice, to one Fuller, a resident of that county, who removed from the State in 1849, leaving the apprentice in charge of the defendant, Hight, also a citizen of Franklin county. Hight placed the apprentice with a son-in-law, who lived in Granville county, where, by the direction of Hight, he stayed as a servant until the close of the year 1857, when he deserted his home, and went at large, in Granville county, until March, 1858; being still a minor, he was brought to the County Court of Franklin, and by that Court bound to Hight, who took him in charge.\\nThe petitioner, the apprentice aforesaid, deeming himself a an inhabitant of Granville county when he was bound to the defendant, Hight, and that the County Court of Franklin had not jurisdiction of the subject-matter, sued a writ of habeas corpus, and prayed to be discharged from the custody of the defendant.\\nThe matter was argued by Badger, with whom was Ed wards, for the petitioner, and B. F. Moore and Miller, for the defendant. Upon the argument of the case, the Judges unanimously agreed, that the petitioner had been lawfully bound to the defendant by the County Court of Franklin. At the request of the Chief Justice, Judge Ruffin drew up an opinion, which was concurred in by Judge Battle, which is contained in the following letter addressed to the Chief Justice :\\n“Raleigh, January 11th, 1859.\\n“ Dear Sir:\\n“ Agreeably to your request, I have considered the case of habeas corpus, which was before you on Saturday, and my conclusion is, that the applicant cannot be discharged.\\nThe gentlemen of the bar put the case, I think, on its true point, namely, ■whether the County Court of Franklin had jurisdiction, so as to render the binding to the present master valid, and I am of opinion that Court had jurisdiction. It is unnecessary to embarrass oneself, in considering this question, by adverting to the law of settlement as to infants generally, or even as to those of color generally ; because, as I conceive, the statutes have created a clear rule in respect to such an infant of color as this applicant, namely, one who was once rightfully bound by the court of a particular county. It is admitted that the original residence and settlement of this boy was in Franklin, and at the time he was first bound. That seems to me to fix the apprentice of color to that county, during his minority, except in the special case provided for, of a removal of the master and apprentice to another county by the consent of Franklin Court, and the assent thereto by the wardens and court of the new county, evidenced by a new binding in the latter county, to the same master. The act requires the person, to whom a free negro is bound, to give bond not to remove the apprentice out of the county, and for the production of him at the expiration of the term, and whenever the court may require in the meanwhile ; with a proviso for a surrender to the court by the master and acceptance by the court, and the further proviso, just mentioned of a removal to another county. If the bond were one voluntarily given by the master, it might be argued that a-removal of the apprentice would give an action on the bond as the only remedy. But this bond is prescribed by the Legislature upon a principle of policy, and the provision of the statute, which requires it, is to he construed as establishing that policy and a rule of law to enforce it, just as much as if the statute declared and enacted them expressly. To what end, then, is the apprentice to be produced, when required by the court which bound him, but that he is to be subject to the control and disposition of that court. If so, then the master may not only be sued, for not producing him, when ordered, but the court may assert its control and power of disposition over the apprentice, in any way, necessary to render it effectual, by bringing in his body, whether found in that county or any other. That is not only a power of the binding court, but it is a duty which the wardens and court of a county, to which the master has removed, (which can only be a county adjoining the first,) may enforce on the first county by a refusal to bind anew, and a removal of the apprentice to his former settlement, according to the 13th section of 86 ch. Devised Code. Such a construction of the acts is the more required, since it is plain that the enactments proceed upon two ideas affecting public policy — the one, the peculiar exposure of this part of our population to oppression and wrong, in being carried to remote parts and made the subject of traffic, and the other, that they may be subjected, while amongst us, to the supervision of a strict police, so as to restrain their propensity to be idle and mischievous ; and that can only be effected by permanently vesting the \\'whole control of the free infant of color in the court which first legally takes charge of him. The power is, therefore, given for the twofold purpose of protection to the child of color from much wrong— even, possibly, of being enslaved in remote places, and in the wholesome exercise of a local police; and the jurisdiction.once attached, it cannot be ousted by the unlawful act of the master or apprentice.\\n“I do not consider it material to enquire, whether the boy might properly.be bound a second time, before cancelling the first indentures after notice to the first master. It would seem, indeed, after so long an abandonment of an apprentice by a master, who had removed from the State, the court must, of necessity, reassu\\'me the charge and care of the infant. ‘ But, at all events, that is a question between the two masters, and cannot found a reason why the boy should not be the apprentice of either, so as to entitle him to the absolute discharge, which is claimed for him.\\n“ He ought, I think, to be remanded to the custody of the defendant.”\\nMost respectfully, your ob’t. servant,\\nThoMAs RueeiN.\\nI concur in the above opinion.\\n¥m. H. Battle. ;\\nI concur in the conclusion of Judge Ruffin, for the reasons set out in the opinion, which lie was kind enough to draw up at my request. It is considered by me, that the petitioner be remanded and put in possession of Herbert II. Ilight, and that the said Ilight recover of Jesse Person, the next friend of the petitioner, his costs to be taxed by the clerk of the Supreme Court, at Raleigh. Let execution issue therefor.\\nR. M. PeaesoN, O. J.\\nDEATH OP CHIEF JUSTICE NASH.\\nThe Chief Justice having died since the last term of the Court, the following proceedings were had :\\n“ IN THE SuTREME COURT, 1\\nMonday, Jan. 3, 1859. [\\nOn the opening of the Court, the Attorney General rose and said:\\nMay it please your Honors:\\nI beg leave to announce to the Court that a meeting of the members of the Bar, in attendance on the Supreme Court, was ■held this morning in the Court’ room, for the purpose of giving expression to the sense of the loss which the country has sustained, by the death of the late lamented and venerable \\'Chief -Justice Nash.\\nIn obedience to- the wishes of the meeting, it becomes my duty to present to the Court, the preamble and resolutions which were- unanimously adopted. In presenting these resolutions, I shall not enter into any extended observations in regard to the character of the deceased, either public or private. He needs no eulogy. For nearly forty years he has been in the public service, and in whatever position he- has been placed, he has performed the duties devolving upon him, with credit to himself and satisfaction to- the public. A man of unsullied private character, he possessed in an eminent degree, those rare and intestimable qualities- both of mind and heart, whieh must command the respect and esteem of all good men,. \"Whilst we feel a deep and sincere-sorrow, at being separated from- such a man, yet we- are-, t® some extent, consoled by the reflection, that he has left behind him an example, that will be a beacon light, a polar star to- guide succeeding generations in the paths- of duty and virtue. Believing, as I do, that each member of the Court will heartily concur in the sentiments expressed in- the-following resolutions, I beg leave to read them- to the Court..\\nThe Attorney General then presented and read the following :\\nAt a meeting of the Bar and officers of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, held at the Court room, in the Capitol, on Monday the M day of January,. 1859..\\nOn motion of Mr. Badger, Hon. William A. Graham was called to the chair and Edmund B. Freeman appointed secretary.\\nOn motion, the chairman appointed P. IT. Winston, sen., W. N. II. Smith, B. S. Donnell, John Pool, John H. Bryan, William A. Jenkins and Hamilton C., Jones, a committee to consider and report resolutions expressive of the feelings of this meeting on the death of the late Chief Justice Nash.\\nMr. Winston, from the committee, reported the following preamble and resolutions:\\nFrederick Nash, late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, having died since the last term, the members •of the bar, and officers of the Court, desire to express their sense of the loss which the country has sustained, in the-death of a magistrate so worthy of the high office, whose duties lie performed with perfect integrity, and eminent usefulness and dignity ; and also to give some outward evidence of sincere sorrow for their separation from a man, whose ardent, yet cheerful piety, at once gave strength and consistency to all his private virtues, and to his manners a pervading and attractive gentleness ; which, joined to the more imposing qualities exhibited by him in his public employments, gained for him universal affection, esteem and admiration ; therefore resolved,\\n1. That the members of this meeting will wear the usual badge of mourning during the present term of the Court.\\n2. That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the family of the decased by the chairman of this meeting.\\n3. That the Attorney General be desired to present the proceedings of this meeting to the Judges of the Supreme Court, with a request that they be entered on the records of the Court.\\nThe preamble and resolutions were seconded by Mr. Badger in a feeling and eloquent address, and after a few impressive remarks from the chairman, were unanimously adopted.\\nThe meeting then adjourned.\\nW. A. GRAHAM, Chm’n.\\nE. B. EeebmaN, Sec’y.\\n\\'Whereupon, Chief Justice Pearson, on behalf of the Court, replied:\\nGentleman of the Bar:\\nThe members of the Court are deeply impressed by the sad event to which your proceedings refer, and join in the sentiments to which you have given expression.\\nTo very extensive legal learning, ripe scholarship, and an elegant and easy style, Judge Nash united a high sense of moral and religious duty, which gave to him a weight of character, that was calculated to command the confidence of the public for the decisions of any tribunal of which he was a member. His distinguishing characteristics were firmness and integrity.\\nHis urbanity and uniform attention to all the courtesies of social life, endeared him to his associates $ and in his death, we feel that we have lost not only oiu- Chief Justice, hut a friend. He had lived the term allotted for human existence— three-score years and ten — he had filled the measure of his usefulness and honor. We were in some degree prepared, and whilst his demise suggests the most solemn considerations, the feeling of regret should not be as unmitigated, as when one is suddenly cut otf in the prime of life.\\nThe Court directs the proceedings of the Bar to he entered on the minutes.\\nCourt adjourned until to-morrow morning, 10 o\\'clock.\\nE. B. BBEEMAN, Cl’k.'"

       "'13roWN, J.\\nTbe plaintiff’s evidence tends to prove that tbe defendant is operating a railroad for conveying lumber; that on 20 May, 1903, tbe engineer of one of its log trains, as be was passing near plaintiff, wantonly and unnecessarily blew tbe whistle of tbe engine on purpose to frighten plaintiff’s mule; that tbe whistle was blown violently and for some time, and for tbe sole purpose of frightening tbe mule; that this blowing did not take place at a crossing and was not done in furtherance of tbe defendant’s business. Tbe evidence tends to prove that tbe engineer blew tbe whistle for amusement and to “make tbe mule dance.”\\nITis Honor submitted these issues:\\n1. Hid defendant’s engineer, fireman or servants unlawfully and wantonly hollow, make noises and sound tbe whistle of the engine for tbe purpose of frightening tbe horses of tbe plaintiff, and was tbe plaintiff injured thereby? Answer: “Yes.”\\n2. What damage, if any, is plaintiff entitled to recover? Answer: “One thousand dollars.”\\nTbe defendant’s counsel contend, through prayers for instruction, first, that it is not liable at all for the wanton tort of its engineer, not done in furtherance of its business and not in the discharge of his duty; second, that it is liable in any event, under the facts of this case, for actual damage only.\\n1. In considering the first proposition, I regard the defendant, although not a carrier of passengers, as a railroad, within the ordinary acceptation of that term. Sawyer v. Lumber Co., at this term. I admit that the entire evidence sIioavs that plaintiff’s cause of action groAvs exclusively out of the AAcrongful and unnecessary act of the engineer, done Avantonly for his OAvn amusement. I fully agree that the rule obtains generally that a master is not ansAverable in damages for the wanton and malicious act of his servant Avhen not done in the legitimate prosecution of the master’s business, and that the evidence in this case presents a “positive affirmative tort, pure and simple,” committed by the engineer Avithout the master’s knoAvledge, approval or ratification.\\nIf Ave had not held that lumber railroads of the kind operated by defendant are to be gwerned by the same rule in relation to the public and to employees as steam roads which are common carriers, I should sustain the contention of defendant in this case. Hemphill v. Lumber Co., 141 N. C., 487; Bird v. Leather Co., 143 N. C., 283. But this immunity from liability for tort referred to is not generally extended to railroads, Avhose seiwants are entrusted Avith such dangerous in-strumentalities and have thereby such unusual and extensive means of doing mischief. This exception to the general rule seems to be established by most abundant authority and for the reason I have given.\\nIn the well-considered case of Bittle v. Railroad, 23 L. R. A., 282, the NeAV Jersey Appellate Court says: “The rule obtains generally that a master is not answerable in damages for the Avanton and malicious acts of his servant. Yet this immunity is not generally extended to railroad corporations, whose servants have such extensive means of doing mischief. Accordingly, it has been established that, if their servants, while in charge of the company’s engines and machinery and engaged about its business, negligently, wantonly or willfully pervert such agencies, the company must respond in damages, ■and this is the principle deducible from the authorities upon this subject.”\\nMr. laggard expresses the principle as follows: “The master’s duty to third persons may arise from ownership or custody of dangerous things, and it may extend to the conduct of the servant, though forbidden, and for the servant’s private purpose and not for the master’s benefit.” Jaggard on Torts, sec. 88.\\nIt is held by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States that the wanton and malicious use of the steam whistle of a locomotive by servants of a railroad company in charge of the locomotive, while in motion on a regular run, renders the company liable for damages on account of injuries caused thereby. Railroad v. Serville, 62 Fed. Rep., 130. The Supreme Court of Illinois held the railroad liable in a case where the engineer, while his locomotive was standing near a crossing at the instant a person was passing the track in front of his engine, negligently or maliciously caused the steam to escape, whereby the team was made to run off and injure plaintiff. Railroad v. Harmon, 47 Ill., 299. This view of the law by which railroads are excepted from the general rule is supported by an array of authority. Railway v. Harrison, 47 Ill., 298; Railway v. Dickson, 63 Ill., 151; Ockridge v. Railway, 90 Ga., 233; Railway v. Triolett, 54 Ark., 289; Cobb v. Railway, 37 S. C., 194; Railway v. Starns, 56 Tenn., 52; Everett v. Receivers, 121 N. C., 521; Brendle v. Railroad, 125 N. C., 474.\\nI think the form and wording of the first issue submitted in this case should make no difference whatever in considering the liability of the defendant for some damage. The case should be considered as if the usual issue as to whether plaintiff was injured by the negligence of defendant had been submitted. I agree with Judge McCormick, in Railroad v. Scoville, supra, that “We are in danger of refining too much when we attempt to distinguish between a negligent and a wanton or malicious use of the steam whistle of the locomotive engine in charge of the proper servants of the company.”\\nThis seems to be the view of thi$ Court in Foot v. Railroad, 142 N. C., p. 52, where it is said: “The breach of duty can be, and frequently is, intentional and willful, and yet the act may be negligent.” T\\'o same effect is Hayes v. Railroad, 141 N. C., 197. The wrongful act in this case, in its relation to the engineer, was a wanton tort; in relation to the master it was a mere breach of duty, growing out of the doctrine of negligence, for which motives of public policy require that the master should compensate the plaintiff for the injury sustained.\\n2. The defendant offered the following prayer, and excepted to the refusal of the Court to give it:\\n“The plaintiff has offered no evidence tending to show that the defendant authorized or ratified the wrongful act of defendant’s agents and servants, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover any amount as exemplary, punitive or vindictive damages.”\\nI tbiulr the Court erred in refusing the prayer and in instructing the jury that they might award punitive damages.\\nIt seems to me that, under all the authorities governing the relation of master and servant, and the liability of the former for the tort of the latter, the defendant is not liable at all for the act of the engineer, except upon the one ground that I have stated. To hold it liable on any other ground is directly against our own recent utterance. Sawyer v. Railroad, 142 N. C., p. 5, and cases cited. This ground of liability, it appears to me, does not warrant the imposition of punitive damages in the\\' absence of evidence tending to show either authorization, ratification or negligence upon the part of its managers in selecting a reckless and improper engineer. ITow far a principal may be mulcted in punitive damages for the act of his agent is a question about which there is much contrariety and not a little confusion of authority; yet the defendant’s contention, upon the facts of this case, appears to me to be supported by most abundant authority, is not in conflict with any of our own decisions, and is founded upon reason and justice. I admit that, where the servants of a corporation engaged in carrying passengers are guilty of acts towards the injured party as a passenger which would subject the servants to exemplary damage, the great weight of authority holds the corporation liable to similar damages, without proof that it ratified or directed the wrongful acts. 3 Sutherland, sec. 950, where all the cases are collected. This is because the corporation can act only through its agents; and when it commits to them the safety and comfort of persons m transitu, over its road, the authority of the corporation pro hac vice is vested in such agents, and “as to such passengers they are the corporation.”\\nUpon this theory a railroad company may be held liable for punitive damages for the insults and rudeness of a conductor to a passenger. Holmes v. Railroad, 94 N. C., 318. I admit that, where the agent of the company is acting within the scope of his duty and in furtherance of its business, the company may be held, under certain circumstances, liable for exemplary damages, even though the injured party is not a passenger. Thus, if the agent of the carrier maliciously uses unnecessary force in ejecting a trespasser, it may be a case for punitive damages. Thompson on Negligence (2d Ed.), sec. 3253. Upon this principle this Court allowed such damages against the company for the conduct of its brakeman in ejecting a trespasser from a train with reckless and unwarranted violence. Hayes v. Railroad, 141 N. C., 199. In that case this Court said: “It would seem, from the authorities, that, where the brakeman is acting for the company and within the scope of his agency, the general principles of the law relating to exemplary or punitive damages apply to him as well as the conductor.” It was the duty of the brakeman to eject trespassers, and in doing so he represented his master, who was held responsible to the same extent that his servant would be held if he acted maliciously and with unnecessary force. As I read the authorities, the master cannot be \\'punished if tbe servant, in the language of Lord Kenyon, “quits sight of the object for which he is employed and, without having in view his master’s orders, pursues that which his own malice suggests. lie then no longer acts in pursuance of the authority given him.” McManus v. Crickett, 1 East, 106.\\nMr. Sedgwick declares that it is the better opinion that no recovery for exemplary damages can be had against the principal for the tort of the agent, unless done under the authority of the principal, or he afterwards approved it, or was grossly negligent in hiring such a servant, or in not preventing him from committing the act. 1 Sedgwick on Damages, sec. 318, and cases cited.\\nThe Encyclopedia, in discussing the liability of corporations for ptaiitive damages, says: “A corporation is liable in exemplary damages for the tortious acts of its agents, if done within the scope of their authority, in all cases where natural persons, acting for themselves, guilty of like tortious acts, ■would be liable to such damages.” 12 Am. and Eng., p. 40.\\nCyclopedia states, after discussing both sides of the question, that the better opinion is that a principal \\'should not be held liable in exemplary damages unless it be shown that the agent acted within his authority, or that the principal approved the act, participated in it, or was guilty of negligence in selecting his servant. 13 Oyc., 114. In support of his text the author cites a great array of cases from many States of the Union.\\nMr. Sutherland, in discussing exemplary damages, sums it up that, where the servant commits a tort in the exercise and scope of his agency, it is deemed, for purposes of compensation, his master’s tort, and exemplary damages are allowable. But, says the author, “it is otherwise as to torts which the servant steps aside from or goes beyond his master’s employment to commit.” “The master is only to be held liable (in exemplary damages) for the act of his servant when the latter is within the scope of his employment.”\\nIt has been held by the Supreme Court of the United States and by some twenty or more State Courts of last resort that neither a corporation nor an individual is liable for exemplary damages for the pure torts of employees, although committed while generally on duty, where the act was without authority, not ratified, and diligence was exercised in selecting suitable agents. Prentice v. Railroad, 147 U. S., 106. See list of courts and cases so holding, cited in 13 Cyc., 117.\\nThere is no judicial deliverance that I can find, from the original charge of Chief Justice Pratt (afterwards Lord Camden), quoted by Justice Cray in the Prentice case, supra, down to the present.time, wherein exemplary damages were allowed or justified, other than as a punishment upon the offender. As they are never awarded by way of compensation, but only for punishment of the offender and as a warning to others, they can only be awarded against one who has actually or by legal construction participated in the offense. Prentice v. Railroad, supra.\\nIn discussing the facts in the opinion of the Court in the case of the Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheaton, 546, Justice Story pronounces the transaction a gross and wanton outrage. Nevertheless, in weighing the extent of the liability of the owners, he says: \"They are innocent of the demerit of this transaction, having neither directed it nor countenanced it nor participated in it in the slightest degree. Under such circumstances we are of the opinion that they are bound to repair all the real injuries and personal wrongs sustained by tbe libellants, but they are not bound to the extent of vindictive damages.”\\nThe rule in admiralty as to exemplary damage is the same as in the common-law courts. Boston Co. v. Fiske, 2 Mason, 119-121.\\nChief Justice Martin expresses the view of the Louisiana Court with much clearness: “It is true, juries sometimes very properly give what is called smart money. They are often rvarranted in giving vindictive damages as a punishment inflicted for outrageous conduct. But this is only justifiable in an action against the wrongdoer, and not against persons who, on account of their relation to the offender, are only consequentially liable for his acts, as the principal is responsible for the acts of his agent.” 8 La., 26.\\n“This rule has same application to corporations as individuals.” Prentice case, supra. . The true ground for holding the master liable in exemplary damages is stated very clearly by Justice Field for the Supreme Court of Massachusetts : “The logical difficulty of imputing the actual malice or fraud of an agent to his principal is, perhaps, less when the principal is a person than when it is a corporation; still, the foundation of the imputation is not that it is inferred that the principal actually participated in the malice or fraud, but that, the act having been done for his benefit by his agent, acting within the scope of his employment in his business, it is just that.he should be held responsible for it in damages.” Lathrop v. Adams, 133 Mass., 471.\\nI take it now to be generally accepted law that, where the agent of a corporation commits a wanton and malicious tort when ácting for the master in \\'the scope of the agency and in fijrtherance of his master’s business, he acts “as and for” the corporation, and for the time being is the corporation, so that the criminal intent necessary to warrant the imposition of exemplary damages is thus brought home to the corporation. But where the agent, going out of the line of his duty, beyond the scope of his agency and not in furtherance of his master’s business, commits a pure tort on his own account, the master, whether an individual or a corporation, is never to be held in exemplary damages. There may be cases where, as in this case and that of the Amiable Nancy, the master should award just compensation for all real injury sustained, but there are none that I can find-where, under such circumstances, the master has been made to pay smart money in addition. If the evidence had disclosed that the engineer, in order.to frighten plaintiff’s mule, .recklessly, wantonly and unnecessarily blew his whistle when approaching a crossing, where it was his duty to blow, then his act would be constructively the corporation’s act, and his malice and wantonness could be imputed to it. But it is admitted there is no such evidence or finding. The entire evidence shows that it was the pure tort of the servant, committed without the scope of his duty, and not in furtherance of his master’s business. While reasons of public policy may hold the master liable for compensatory damages solely upon the grounds stated heretofore in this opinion, there are no reasons of policy or justice for punishing the master for the malicious tort of his servant, which the master could not help, which was not done in the scope of the servant’s duty, for which the master derived no benefit, which he did not ratify, and under circumstances when the servant could not be said in any sense to represent or act for him.\\nFor the reasons given, I think there should be a new trial on the issue of damages.'"

       " \"There was a verdict and judgment for 'defendant.\",\n",
       " 'Plaintiff noted exceptions to the charge and appealed.',\n",
       " 'The facts pertinent to the exceptions and the decision of the appeal are: Defendant company, in connection with its other business, made “dry cans,” which were used in woolen mills to dry yarn after it had been dyed.',\n",
       " 'It was necessary that they should be steam-tight in order that they could be filled with steam, and heat the surface so that yarns would dry.',\n",
       " 'They were cylindrical in shape, 6 or 7 feet long and from 1 foot to iy2 feet across the ends, with iron heads and bands shrunk around the heads.',\n",
       " 'The manner of testing the cans for leaks was as follows: The cans, after having the iron heads strongly fastened on by shrinking an iron band around them, were taken outdoors, near the boiler house, and a pipe connected with the boiler would carry steam into an opening at one end of the cans, this opening being half an inch in diameter.',\n",
       " 'On the pipe taking the steam into the can there was a steam cock to turn off the steam, the amount of steam passing through the pipe depending on how far this valve or cock was turned.',\n",
       " 'There was also on this pipe a steam gauge to indicate the amount of steam pressure passing through the pipe into the can.',\n",
       " 'In order to test the cans it was necessary to hold the pressure at from 10 to 15 pounds, the cans being capable of standing a pressure of 50 pounds.',\n",
       " 'After the steam had been let into the can, the can was struck with a hammer in the hands of the person whose business it was to see if there were any leaks, the stroke of the hammer being intended to indicate the leaks by the steam coming out.',\n",
       " 'At the opposite end of the can into which the steam came there was a pipe sticking out, with an outlet 1 inch in diameter, and at this end, to regulate the amount of steam pressure, the plaintiff was at work with a piece of scantling pressed against a stob in the ground, or the toe of his foot, as he chose; upon the scantling there was nailed a piece of leather, and at the point where the leather was nailed the scantling was pressed against the outlet.',\n",
       " 'It was his business to watch the steam gauge at the other end, which was some 6 or 8 feet from him, and, by turning the scantling from side to side, reduce or increase the pressure.',\n",
       " 'While at work, for some reason, the head blew out and the scantling struck the plaintiff-on the head.',\n",
       " 'Plaintiff alleged that defendant was negligent, in that it failed to provide a safety valve which was in general use by those performing this class of work, so that the steam would automatically escape beyond the pressure desired.',\n",
       " 'There was evidence tending to show that safety valves are in common use wherever any pressure is used in the form of steam or water; that they are used on everything that contains a pressure in order to make it safe.',\n",
       " 'It is very important to have a safety valve there when one would not know the condition of the steam gauge; it may be right or it may be wrong.',\n",
       " 'It is proper to use a safety valve on a machine when testing it.',\n",
       " 'One could not guarantee it unless a safety valve was on it.',\n",
       " 'It was not safe to test the cylinder with steam* without using a safety valve.',\n",
       " 'It is dangerous, for the simple reason that a steam gauge cannot be adjusted as quickly as steam will adjust itself.',\n",
       " 'Steam itself will find a way out of a boiler quicker than one can turn it out if the proper spring is waiting for it at the point to take action.',\n",
       " 'A steam gauge is no safety whatever on a boiler.',\n",
       " 'It simply gives you time to get away before it blows up!',\n",
       " 'A safety valve is simply to take care of you while around the boiler.',\n",
       " 'It is not safe for a man to stand at this end of this cylinder here and adjust it with a stick and tell by looking at that gauge what pressure of steam was in the cylinder, if he did that constantly.',\n",
       " 'A witness testified: “I understand tbe use of a safety valve.',\n",
       " 'It is used to carry a certain amount of pressure in tbe boiler and give number of pounds to tbe square inch.',\n",
       " 'It is set for tbe purpose required.',\n",
       " 'It works automatically.',\n",
       " 'When it gets to the given pounds of pressure it is set back and relieves tbe pressure itself.',\n",
       " 'If it is set for 10 pounds pressure and the pressure becomes more than 10 pounds, it blows off.',\n",
       " 'Safety valves are in general use in steam machinery or vessels charged with steam.',\n",
       " 'I do not remember ever seeing a boiler that did not have some kind of a safety valve on it.',\n",
       " \"If a safety valve bad been' on tbe can, set for 10 pounds, and more then 10 pounds came into the pipe leading to the can, it would have relieved itself.\",\n",
       " 'It is the general use to have safety valves on all vessels carrying steam.”\\nThere was evidence that safety valves corrode and fail to operate.',\n",
       " 'There was also evidence that the way provided for plaintiff to do the work assigned to him was safe; that the steam gauge indicated the amount of steam in the boiler.',\n",
       " 'There was no evidence of any defect in the material of which the boiler was constructed.',\n",
       " 'Defendant contended that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.',\n",
       " 'Both parties submitted a number of prayers for special instructions.',\n",
       " 'Among other instructions given by his Honor, he said to the jury that the duty of the employer was met if he furnished to bis employee reasonably safe appliances for his work, etc.',\n",
       " 'He further said: “If the gauge was a reasonably safe appliance, it does not make any difference that the defendant didn’t furnish a safety valve; but if it was not reasonably safe without a safety valve, then it would be negligence on the part of the defendant not to furnish a safety valve, provided that you should find that safety valves were in common use in work of this kind.” Plaintiff excepted.',\n",
       " '“When you come to consider the allegations of negligence directed at the fact that the defendant did not furnish a safety valve, I charge you that you cannot find that the defendant was negligent in this respect, from the fact alone that you may find that if it had been adopted it would have had a tendency to decrease the risk and make the work safer; but in order to find the defendant guilty of negligence on account of this allegation, you must find from the evidence that a safety valve was so manifestly serviceable and necessary as to command the adoption thereof by reasonably prudent men in the same business so generally that it could not reasonably be ignored or disregarded.” Plaintiff excepted.',\n",

       "  'text': \"CoNNOR, J.,\\nafter stating the facts: There can be no just criticism of his Honor’s charge, in so far as he defines the duty of the master to furnish to his servant a reasonably safe place to work and reasonably safe appliances with which to perform the service. Plaintiff contends that he should have gone further and told the jury that when a safety appliance in the operation of dangerous instrumentalities is known, approved and in general use, the standard of duty fixed by the law requires the employer to furnish such appliance to his employee; that the use of such appliance became the standard of duty in respect to the safety of the employee; in other words, in contemplation of law, the reasonably prudent man will furnish to his employee such appliances as are known, approved and in general use, rather than rely upon his own judgment of what is reasonably safe. In applying this principle, care must be taken to correctly define the terms “known, approved and in general use,” in respect to the extent and the time during which it is in such general use. The employer is not required to adopt every new appliance or invention which may be put upon the market. A sufficient number of persons for a sufficient length of time must be shown to have approved and used tbe appliance to- test its value and efficiency to make it generally approved and used, witbin the .meaning of the term. It must further appear that such appliance is reasonably within the reach of the employer. Applying the rule to the admitted facts and to plaintiff’s evidence, we have, for the purpose of passing upon the exception, this case: Defendant, for the purpose of testing the capacity to resist the pressure of steam for the purpose for which it was made, attached the cylinder by means of an iron pipe one-half inch in diameter to a boiler, and, by turning the valve, the steam from the boiler rushed into the cylinder. The cylinder had a capacity to resist a pressure of 50 pounds. The test could be made by putting in it 10 to 15 pounds. The boiler had a generating capacity of 60 to 80 pounds of steam. The evidence tended to show that the valve was turned'one-fourth of an inch. On the pipe a gauge was set, and plaintiff was placed, for the purpose of discharging the duty imposed upon him, 8 or 10 feet from the gauge. At the end of the cylinder and at the point at which plaintiff stood was an appliance for turning off the steam if the gauge indicated too much pressure. This appliance was in charge of plaintiff. The cylinder exploded, as described by the witnesses, and injured plaintiff. Plaintiff insists, and introduced evidence tending to show, that the known, approved and generally used method of preventing an explosion of such a cylinder by reason of an excess of steam was a safety valve. His evidence tended to show that a steam gauge was not reliable. One witness said: “A man cannot constantly look at a gauge without his eyes getting so that the figures run together. Looking at a gauge five minutes, a man cannot tell one figure from another. A man cannot look at a gauge constantly at 10 and watch, it stand at 10 for five minutes and hold the pressure in, himself. It would not be safe to put any steam in there without having a safety valve.” On the other hand, the defendant introduced several witnesses who said that the gauge and arrangement made for letting off tbe steam were safe and mucb better than a safety valve, giving reasons for their opinion. In this condition of the evidence the rule laid down by his Honor was clearly correct, and in this aspect of the case no just criticism can be made of the charge. But the plaintiff insists that he has gone further and shown, not only that a safety valve was the safer mode of letting off excessive steam, but that it was the method known, approved and in general use. The witnesses upon this point say that they have had experience in operating cylinders into which steam was put, and that it is usual to have a safety valve upon them; that this was the general custom. They explain by saying that if in any way a greater quantity of steam went into the cylinder than'the valve was “set for,” it would automatically open and the steam in excess of the quantity provided for would, as the witnesses say, “blow out.” If the jury should find as a fact that the safety valve upon such cylinders or similar vessels into which steam is put and which were subjected to pressure was known, approved and in general use as a safety appliance, we are of the opinion that the defendant owed to plaintiff the duty of using it; that is, furnishing such .appliance to plaintiff for his protection. In Empson Packing Co. v. Vaughan, 27 Col., 66, it appeared that a cylindrical apparatus called a cooker, made of iron, in which the vegetables previously canned were placed for the purpose of subjecting them to a sufficient degree of heat to complete the process of canning, was used. This was done by closing the cooker perfectly tight and turning in steam which was supplied from boilers through a pipe connecting the two. It was alleged in that case “that the explosion was due to the excessive pressure of steam confined in the cooker, which would have been avoided had it been provided with a safety valve so regulated as to allow the escape of steam upon reaching a pressure within the limits of safety, or the pipe connecting the cooker with the boiler had been equipped with a pressure regulator 'which would have auto matically prevented the pressure exerted by the steam reaching beyond a fixed point.”\\nTbe Court says: “In some establishments safety valves were used; in others.only the thermometer and gauge used by appellant. * * * Which of these appliances was the one which the exercise of reasonable care and prudence would adopt? Steam has ever been acknowledged as a dangerous agency, the use of which results in accidents, even when the most approved safety appliances are utilized. The cooker was connected directly with the boilers, and was only capable of withstanding a much less degree of pressure than the steam generated in these receptacles usually exerted. It was designed to be used with a safety valve. The thermometer and gauge on the cooker would not instantly indicate the pressure of the steam within it. The steam was only controlled by a globe valve on the pipe through which it was conducted to the cooker. Before any warning of dangerous pressure would be indicated by the thermometer and gauge, an explosion might occur.” In that case there was no evidence that the safety valve was in general use; on the contrary, it appeared that both appliances were used. The Court held that the failure to furnish the safety valve was evidence of negligence for the jury. A verdict for the plaintiff was sustained. We do not hold in this case that the mere failure to furnish the safety valve as a safety appliance was, as a matter of law, negligence, but that if the jury find that it was known, approved and in general use, the failure to. do so would be negligence. The testimony upon this question is conflicting and was properly submitted to the jury. The error consists in failing to direct the minds of the jury to the effect which they should give to the failure of defendant to have the safety valve, if they further found that it was known, approved and in general use. The principle which this Court has adopted, and which we think correct, is thus stated by Mr. Justice Rohe in Bradley v. Railroad, 144 N. C., 555: “When the employees are en gaged in the operation of mills and other plants having machinery more or less complicated and usually driven by mechanical power, in such case an arbitrary standard of duty has been fixed, and the employer is required to pi'ovide methods, placing, implements and appliances such as are known, approved and in general use,” citing Hicks v. Manufacturing Co., 138 N. C., 319; Horne v. Power Co., 141 N. C., 50; Fearington v. Tobacco Co., 141 N. C., 80. Defendant insists that no general use was shown. While it is true that the evidence does not show that others were engaged in the manufacture of cylinders or iron cans of the exact size, strength and character as the one in controversy, it does appear that when cylinders of similar kind, construction, etc., are in use, the known, approved and usual method of providing against danger from an explosion caused by excessive steam is to place upon them a safety valve, which, for the reasons given by the witnesses, would appear to be the most reliable safety appliance. It is impossible for courts to do more than apply the principles by which the duty of the employer is fixed to the cases as they arise. An examination of Labott’s work on Master and Servant and the elaborate notes, together with the encyclopedias, shows the almost innumerable decisions applying the general principles to particular cases. While the courts are not disposed to unduly burden the industries of the country by imposing unreasonable or impracticable demands upon the employer, yet it is their duty to so declare and enforce the law that the lives and limbs of employees are rendered as safe as reasonable care can secure. It is in accordance with a humane and sound public policy that employers be required to exercise the degree of care known, approved and in 'general use. To require this imposes no hardship upon them. We have so held, and the law in that respect has been crystallized into a statute that railroad companies must do so. Greenlee’s case, 122 N. C., 977; Troxler’s case, 124 N. C., 189. There was evidence tending to show that tbe method of testing the cylinder in use at the time of plaintiff’s injury had been used for a long time without accident, and that it was not only reasonably safe, but to be preferred to the safety valve. It may be that the jury did not find that the safety valve was approved and in general use on such cylinders as the one by the explosion of which plaintiff was injured. If they had found otherwise, his Honor’s instruction did not permit them to give to such finding the effect of imposing the duty to furnish the safety valve. . It is this omission of which plaintiff complains. Defendant insists that the evidence, if believed, did not show a general use of the safety valve on such cylinders, citing Marks’ case, 135 N. C., 287. We think that there was evidence fit to be submitted to the jury upon the question. Of course, its weight and value were for the jury. Eor the error in the instruction in this respect there must be a\\nNew Trial.\",\n",
