The deposition of plaintiff was introduced, containing full and direct statement that plaintiff bought the note for full value and same was duly indorsed to him by the payees before maturity and without notice of any fraud or other infirmity affecting its validity. The indorsement was denied in the pleadings, and there were also allegations on the part of defendants to the effect that there was a breach of warranty on the part of McLaughlin Bros, in the sale, and further that the sale was procured by false and fraudulent representations on the part of the said vendors, to defendant\\\\u2019s damage. The jury, having been impaneled and evidence offered, at the close of the testimony the court intimated that he would charge the jury that if they found the facts to be as testified in the deposition, the plaintiff could recover, to which defendants then and there excepted. Counsel for defendant then stated to the court, \\\\u201cthat they took the position that there was sufficient evidence to be found in the testimony to go to the jury on the question as to whether the jury believed the evidence of the plaintiff in the action. The court stated he would not allow a verdict to stand in favor of the defendants,\\\\u2019\\\\u2019 this statement being made in the hearing of the jury, and defendants excepted.</summary>\\\\n  <summary id=\\\\\"b270-5\\\\\"><page-number citation-index=\\\\\"1\\\\\" label=\\\\\"230\\\\\">*230</page-number>There was verdict for plaintiff for full amount of the note and interest; judgment according to verdict, and defendant excepted and appealed, alleging errors.</summary>\\\\n  <attorneys id=\\\\\"b270-6\\\\\">\\\\n    <em>McLean, Parser &amp; McLean and Loftin &amp; Dawson for plaintiff.</em>\\\\n  </attorneys>\\\\n  <attorneys id=\\\\\"b270-7\\\\\">\\\\n    <em>Q.

Petty, </em>153 N. C., 462; <em>Mayers v. </em>McRim<em>mon, </em>140 N. C., 640; <em>Tyson v. Joyner, </em>139 N. C., 69.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\\\\\"b270-9\\\\\">In the present case there was allegation, with evidence on the part of defendant, tending to show that there was a breach of warranty, in the sale, on the part of these vendors.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\\\\\"b270-10\\\\\">On a perusal of the entire testimony, we think there was evidence tending to show fraud and deceit on their part, inducing the sale and causing damage, under the principles stated in <em>Myers v. Petty, supra; Whitehurst v. Insurance Co., </em>149 N. C., 273; <em>May v. Loomis, </em>140 N. C., 350, and cases of like import. The instrument, too, was payable to order and the indorsement was denied in the pleadings, thus putting on plaintiff, in order to shut off the defenses arising on the testimony, the burden of showing that the instrument had been indorsed and that he was otherwise a holder in due course. True; the deposition of plaintiff, introduced on the trial, contains full and direct statement, tending to show that plaintiff was indorsee for value before maturity and in all respects a holder of the note in due course, and it may be that his Honor was right in intimating that he would charge the jury \\\\u201cthat if they found the facts to be as <page-number citation-index=\\\\\"1\\\\\" label=\\\\\"231\\\\\">*231</page-number>testified to in tbe deposition there should be a verdict in plaintiff\\\\u2019s favor; but in this and every other case, when proof is required to establish a determinative issue, the credibility of the evidence is for the jury, and they must be allowed to consider and pass upon it themselves. We\\'have so held in a case on this very subject, <em>Bank v. Fountain, </em>148 N. C., 590, and a new trial was granted in that case because the court erroneously invaded the province of the jury by telling them that \\\\u201cthe <em>prima facie </em>case of plaintiff had been restored by the uncontradicted evidence of the president of the bank, etc.\\\\u201d The opinion in question quotes with approval from <em>Bank v. Iron Works, </em>159 Mass., 158, as follows: \\\\u201cIn an action on a promissory note, which was defended on the ground that the note had been fraudulently put into circulation by the P. L. Co., a Massachusetts corporation, organized for the purpose of \\\\u2018doing a brokerage business in commercial paper, stocks, bonds, and other property,\\\\u2019 from whom the plaintiff company acquired it, the plaintiff\\\\u2019s officers testified that the note was taken by them in good faith and for value, before maturity, and the defendant introduced no testimony to contradict these officers: <em>Held, </em>that the defendant was entitled, nevertheless, to go to the jury on the question whether the plaintiff took the note for value and without notice of fraud.\\\\u201d</p>\\\\n    <p id=\\\\\"b271-6\\\\\">Under the conditions stated, therefore, with the controlling issue to be determined, and involving the credibility of plaintiff\\\\u2019s testimony, tending to establish it, his Honor had no. right to say in the hearing of the jury, \\\\u201cthat he would not allow a verdict to stand in favor of defendants.\\\\u201d The Court has been always swift to enforce obedience to our law which forbids a presiding judge to express an opinion on the disputed facts of a trial, and under numerous decisions construing the statute, we must hold this remark of his Honor, in the presence of the jury and before verdict, to be reversible error. <em>S. v. R. R., </em>149 N. C., 508; <em>Withers v. Lane, </em>144 N. C., 184; <em>S. v. Dixon, </em>75 N. C., 275; <em>Nash v. Morton, </em>48 N. C., 3. The expression objected to was undoubtedly an inadvertence. From a long, intimate, and much valued association with his Honor, when. <page-number citation-index=\\\\\"1\\\\\" label=\\\\\"232\\\\\">*232</page-number>we were at the bar together and from observation of his work as a judicial officer, the writer knows of a certainty that there is no man or judge who places higher estimate on the value of the trial by jury or holds deeper conviction that it should now and always be preserved in its fullest integrity. For the error indicated, defendant is entitled to a new trial, and \\'it is so ordered.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\\\\\"b272-6\\\\\">New trial.</p>\\\\n  </opinion>\\\\n</casebody>\\\\n\"}}\\n'"

NORFOLK SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY.</parties>\\n  <decisiondate id=\"b97-9\">(Filed 13 September, 1916.)</decisiondate>\\n  <headnotes id=\"b97-10\">Carriers of Passengers — Ejection from Train — Through Trains — Change of Trains — Damages.</headnotes>\\n  <headnotes id=\"b97-11\">The ticket agent of a railroad company should inform the purchaser of a ticket for a through train whether or not this train will stop at the passenger’s destination; and where a female passenger on such train, traveling with her child, has been informed by the ticket agent that the train will stop at her destination, and while on the train she was, for the first time, informed by the conductor that she will have to get off at a nearer station and take a local train, in consequence of which she was not met by her husband, as they had prearranged, and suffers inconvenience and annoyance by reason of the enforced change for the local train: <em>Held, </em>the ejection from the train was wrongful, making the company liable for the passenger’s actual but not punitive damages.</headnotes>\\n  <summary id=\"b97-12\">Civil actioN tried at January Term, 1916, of PasquotaNK, before <em>Bond, J., </em>upon these issues:</summary>\\n  <summary id=\"b97-13\">1. Did defendant wrongfully put or cause plaintiff to get off its train at Edenton, as alleged? Answer: “Yes.”</summary>\\n  <summary id=\"b97-14\">2. If so, what damage, if any, did the plaintiff sustain thereby? Answer: “$50.”</summary>\\n  <summary id=\"b97-15\">From the judgment rendered, the defendant appealed.</summary>\\n  <attorneys id=\"b97-16\">J. <em>M. Meelcins for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\\n  <attorneys id=\"b97-17\">\\n    <em>O. M. Bain and J. Kenyon Wilson for defendant.</em>\\n  </attorneys>\\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\\n    <author id=\"b97-18\">EbowN, J.</author>\\n    <p id=\"AD\">The evidence tends to prove that on 19 November, 1914, the plaintiff, accompanied by her little daughter, purchased from the defendant’s agent at Mackeys Ferry a ticket to Chapanoke, upon the assurance of the agent that the ticket was good for continuous passage upon the through train of the defendant, which passed Mackeys Ferry about 1 o’clock. ITpon inquiry, the agent assured her that there would be no change of trains at Edenton.</p>\\n    <p id=\"b97-19\">The plaintiff’s husband, by arrangement, met this through train , at Chapanoke to carry his wife to their home, some distance in the country. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>As the plaintiff did not arrive on this train, the husband returned home. When this train of the defendant, which runs from New Bern to Norfolk, and passes Mackeys Ferry, arrived at Edenton, the conductor for the first time informed her that this train did not stop at Chapanoke, and told the plaintiff that if she did not get off at Edenton he would carry her on to some other point.</p>\\n    <p id=\"b98-6\">Plaintiff was compelled to get off at Edenton and take the next train, an hour or more later, which was a local train and stopped at Chap-anoke. When she arrived at Chapanoke her husband had gone home. It was a rainy, blustery day, and plaintiff was subjected to much inconvenience by reason of having to change trains at Edenton.</p>\\n    <p id=\"b98-7\">The motion to nonsuit was properly overruled.</p>\\n    <p id=\"b98-8\">The plaintiff had the right to rely upon the assurance of the agent that the train which she took at Mackeys Ferry would .stop at Chapanoke to put her off. It was the duty of the agent, when he sold a ticket to Chapanoke, to inform the plaintiff that she would have to take a local train at Edenton and would arrive at Chapanoke some time after the other train had passed. Upon the assurance of the defendant’s agent, the plaintiff had reason to believe that she would meet her husband there to take her and her little daughter to their home. <em>Hutchinson v. R. R., </em>140 N. C., 125, and cases cited.</p>\\n    <p id=\"b98-9\">His Honor very properly ruled that there is no evidence upon which the jury would be justified in awarding punitive damage.</p>\\n    <p id=\"b98-10\">No error.</p>\\n  </opinion>\\n</casebody>\\n'}}"

Salk. </em>282./ Taylor e contra, insisted that however the law may be in respect of common carriers, who undertake, like all other persons exercising public employments, for skill and diligence in their pro-tession, no such undertaking is implied, or expected, from one who undertakes, at the request of another, to perform a business which he does not make his common einploy-merit; and he is only answerable for damages where he is guilty of gross neglect.MS <em>Bl. Gom. </em>165. The jury ■found for the Defendant. The Court granted a new trial, saying the verdict was against law, as the Defendant, by reason of the reward, was to be considered as a common carrier. At this term the cause being again tried, <em>Moore </em>for the Plaintiff, <em>Haywood </em>for the Defendant, who said one part of the definition of a common carrier is, “ that he was a person liable to bo sued by the Plaintiff, if he refused to carry the goods for him, for the common reward <em>; </em>and is such a person who undertakes to serve all persons indifferently.” <em>Salk. </em>249. 1 <em>Ba. M. </em>344. Tiie word <em>common </em>is added to distinguish him from one who undertakes for hire, on a particular occasion, to carry goods for another, who is not answerable in all events, bui only for neglect. <em>Cro. Ja. </em>262. The latter is only subject to rules of law formed on natural <em>justice, </em>the former is liable to an additional rule flowing from policy and dictated by necessity — lie is a public servant, employed by every one, by those who do not know him, as well as by those who do — lie has frequent opportunities of procuring himself to be robbed, or of divesting himself of ihe goods unfairly, without, a possibility of detection, and the public would have no security unless inevitable accident or irresistible force, were his only grounds of excuse, and these to be fully and fairly proven by himself. Being a person in public employment, the law requires ofhim security to the public for his good behaviour, and obtains it by ¡imposing on him general responsibility, with only two exceptions. <em>Salk. </em>282. <em>L. Bay. </em>918. True it is, the books say in some instances that persons carrying goods for hire are common carriers, and they sometimes speak of carriers only, without the additional word <em>common. </em>But these are inaccuracies, and to he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>explained or understood in a manner which accords with the spirit, not the letter of the case. A person carrying goods for hire, most be intended of one who makes it his common employment, and the means of his livelihood.— 2 <em>L. Bay. </em>918 — and where it is said a carrier is absolutely liable, must be understood of a person of that description. Suppose the Plaintiff, in the present case, had gone to the Defendant’s with the common price for the carriage of goods from Virginia to Hillsborough, and required of him to proceed to Virginia and receive the goods, and to bring them to Hillsborough — .might not the Defendant have refused ? — Was he bound to undertake the business assigned him ? No, certainly he was not. And why ? Because he had not undertaken to serve the public generally; or in the words of my <em>L. Holt, (Salk. </em>249,) “all persons indifferently for hire in\\' carrying goods from place to place.” if he is not thus bound, he is not that common carrier spoken of in the law-books, and in the cases produced, who is liable in all events, except for the acts of God, and public enemies— and lie must then stand upon the ground of a person whose common business it is not, undertaking to do an act for another at his request and for him — the employer knowing him not to be commonly conversant in tiiat business, 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>166. In other words, he is not liable to the political rule before mentioned, but to the rule only which results from natural justice, which requires no more of him than common and usual prudence, and diligence in the performance of what he has undertaken, and does not subject him to answer for accidents which have not happened for want of that prudence and diligence. Of tliis opinion were the Court, consisting of Macay and Wihiams, and under their direction, the jury found for the Defendant.</summary>\\n  <opinion type=\"majority\">\\n    <p id=\"b29-8\">Note. — Vide, as corroborative of this decision, <em>Jones’s Law of Bailments, </em>106.
