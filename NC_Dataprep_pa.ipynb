      "  Per Curiam. The witnesses appear to have used the square foot value as the unit by which to fix the total value. Admittedly the lot was 188.36 ft. x 92 ft. One of the City’s \"witnesses, by mistake, had calculated total value on the basis of 90 rather than 92 feet. While he was on the stand his error was discovered and corrected before the jury. However, in the Court’s statement of the contention of the parties and in the recapitulation of the evidence, the Court did not specifically call attention to the fact that the witness Smith, in his direct examination, had based his estimate of value on 90 rather than 92 feet frontage. At the conclusion of the charge, the appellants failed to request the Court to make any correction or amplification, either of the evidence or the contention of the parties. The defendants cite and rely on the cases of Town of Davidson v. Stough, 258 N.C. 23, 127 S.E. 2d 762 as furnishing ground for a new trial. However, the Stough case is not in point here. In Stough, the trial court, in charging the jury, had misconstrued the extent of the easement rights which the Town of Davidson had acquired in the owner’s property, a material consideration in fixing just compensation. In the case at Bar, the City took the fee in the whole property, leaving the owners nothing. It is difficult to see how the jurors could have been misled or that they did not fully understand the correct measurement of the lot. In the verdict and judgment we find No error. \n",

      "  CONNOR, J. The plaintiff is a corporation, organized under the laws of this State, with its principal place of business in the city of Raleigh, Wake County. The defendants are citizens of this State, and are residents of Forsyth County. The action was begun and is now pending in the Superior Court of Wake County, which is the proper venue for its trial (C. S., 469, Smith-Douglass Co. v. Honeycutt, 204 N. C., 219, 167 S. E., 810), unless, as contended by the defendants, the action is for the foreclosure of a mortgage on land in Forsyth County. In that case, the proper venue for its trial is Forsyth County (C. S., 463(3), Connor v. Dillard, 129 N. C., 50, 39 S. E., 641), and there was error in the denial of defendants’ motion for its removal, as a matter of right, to said county, for trial. The motion was duly made before the time for the filing of an answer to the complaint had expired, and was therefore in apt time. C. S., 470. The motion was not addressed to the discretion *535of tbe court, but was denied as a matter of law. Tbe only question, therefore, presented by tbis appeal is whether there was error in such denial, and the answer to this question depends upon the nature and purpose of the action. The nature and purpose of an action is to be determined by the allegations of the complaint, and not by the prayer for relief on the facts alleged in the complaint. Jones v. R. R., 193 N. C., 590, 137 S. E., 706. In that case it is said that his prayer is not the measure of the relief to which the plaintiff is entitled upon the allegations of his complaint. The prayer does not narrow or enlarge the relief to which the plaintiff is entitled. He may recover such relief as he is entitled to upon the facts alleged in his complaint, and established by his proof. Therefore, the nature of his action must be determined by the allegations of his complaint, and not by the specific relief for which he prays. Shrago v. Gulley, 174 N. C., 135, 93 S. E., 458; Warren v. Herrington, 171 N. C., 165, 88 S. E., 139; Baber v. Hanie, 163 N. C., 588, 80 S. E., 57; Councill v. Bailey, 154 N. C., 54, 69 S. E., 760. In the last cited case, which was an action to recover the purchase money for a tract of land, and for the specific performance by the defendant of his contract for the purchase of said land, it is said: “In this case the plaintiff, it is true, asks for a judgment for the purchase money, but he adds a general prayer for such other and further relief as he may be entitled to — that is, not only for a money judgment, but that he may also have full relief according to the facts he has alleged, and within the scope of the case made by his complaint, the allegations of the complaint being sufficient in form and substance to fully warrant a judgment for a specific performance of the contract in every respect, and at least for the declaration of the vendor’s lien upon the land, and a direction for a sale thereof to satisfy the debt. Even under the former system, when the two jurisdictions of equity and law were kept separate and distinct, it was settled by actual adjudication and the highest authority that a prayer for general relief covers and includes a prayer for specific performance, or any particular relief permitted under a general prayer, where the statement in the body of the bill was sufficient to authorize the granting of such specific relief.” In the instant case, on the facts alleged in its complaint, the plaintiff prays judgment. “1. That it recover of the defendants the sum of $2,350.71, with interest thereon from 21 August, 1933; 2. For the costs of the action; 3. For such other and further relief as plaintiff may be entitled to in law or equity.” *536If the allegations of its complaint are established by its proof at the trial, the plaintiff will be entitled not only to the specific relief prayed for, but also to a decree foreclosing the mortgage executed by the defendants, by which the payment of the sum of $2,350.71, and interest is secured. The land conveyed by the mortgage is in Forsyth County. That county is therefore the proper venue for the trial of the action, and there was error in the denial of defendants’ motion for the removal of the action to said county for trial. Where on the facts alleged in his complaint, the plaintiff is entitled not only to a judgment that he recover of the defendant the amount of his debt, but also to a decree for the foreclosure of the mortgage by which his debt is secured, and the action was begun and is pending in the county in which the plaintiff resides, but the land conveyed by the mortgage is in another county, the plaintiff cannot deprive the defendant of his right, under the statute, to the removal of the action to the county in which the land is situate, for trial, by his failure to pray for a foreclosure of the mortgage, at least, when he prays judgment for his debt, and also for such other and further relief as he may be entitled to, in law or in equity, on the facts alleged in his complaint. If the law were otherwise, the defendant could be deprived of a right conferred by statute (O. S., 463(3), and not resting in the discretion of the court, or dependent upon the arbitrary choice of the plaintiff. In such case, the plaintiff has not surrendered his right to a decree of foreclosure, in the event he recovers judgment for his debt, and may, after the trial, insist upon such right. This the law does not, and ought not to tolerate. Reversed. Stacy, C. J., dissents. \n",

      "  MARTIN (Harry C-), Judge. Plaintiffs first three assignments of error concern the trial court’s exclusion of her testimony regarding the value of the trailer in question. She argues that this testimony was competent in determining the issue of damages. She further contends that its exclusion constituted prejudicial error, because the trial court granted defendant’s motion for a directed verdict on the basis of plaintiff’s failure to present evidence of damages. [1] In evaluating the merits of plaintiffs argument, this Court must first determine the merits of plaintiff’s three claims for relief. Plaintiffs first claim for relief, based upon the alleged breach of the Residential Rental Agreements act by defendant, is invalid. This act did not become effective until 1 October 1977. The written agreement between plaintiff and defendant was signed almost one year prior to this date. In plaintiff’s third claim for relief, she sought to recover a share of the insurance proceeds recovered by defendant after the trailer burned. Plaintiff failed to present any authority or evidence supporting this claim. *552Moreover, upon considering the three issues presented to the jury, it appears that plaintiff relied solely upon her second claim for relief at trial. [2] Plaintiffs second claim for relief relies upon a breach of the Retail Installment Sales Act.-In her complaint plaintiff alleged that the agreement between the parties, entitled “Lease with Option to Purchase Trailer,” constituted a consumer credit sale under North Carolina’s Retail Installment Sales Act. Under this act such a sale includes but is not limited to any contract in the form of a bailment or lease if the bailee or lessee contracts to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to or in excess of the aggregate value of the goods and services involved, and it is agreed that the bailee or lessee will become, or for no other, or for a nominal consideration, has the option to become, the owner of the goods and services upon full compliance with his obligations under such contract. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25A-2(b) (Cum. Supp. 1981). The parties’ written agreement comes within this definition. The parties stipulated that plaintiff had missed some of her monthly payments. This delinquency, though, did not terminate the agreement since defendant never exercised its option in the agreement to terminate the contract upon plaintiffs failure to make a payment. Plaintiff further alleged in her complaint that defendant violated N.C.G.S. 25A-20 of the Retail Installment Sales Act by including in the agreement the words, “Leased as is.” These words excluded defendant’s express warranty to repair the trailer. She alleged that a willful violation of N.C.G.S. 25A-20 constituted an unfair trade practice entitling her to treble damages. See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25A-44(4) (Cum. Supp. 1981). At trial plaintiff presented testimony that Myers informed her he would fix specified defects in the trailer before it was delivered; that the trailer was delivered in its defective condition; that plaintiff repeatedly requested Myers to repair the trailer after it was delivered; that Myers continued to promise that the repairs would be made, and that the defects were never repaired. Plaintiff also offered into evidence the written agreement signed by the parties. This agreement contained a list of defects to be repaired. Plaintiff, therefore, was entitled to present evidence of *553damages caused by the alleged breach of defendant’s express warranty to repair. [3] Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the general measure of damages for breach of warranty “is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-2-714(2) (1965). Special circumstances in the case sub judice would seem to require that plaintiff recover only a fraction of the difference between the fair market value of the trailer as delivered and the value of the trailer as warranted. Specifically, at the time the trailer burned, plaintiff had not made the total payments required to exercise her option to buy the trailer. The fraction to which she is entitled is therefore the total payments made by plaintiff over the total value of the trailer as warranted. In the event of a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff upon retrial, she would be entitled to treble damages. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25A-44(4) (Cum. Supp. 1981). [4] During the trial the court sustained defendant’s objections to questions pertinent to the issue of damages. These questions concerned plaintiff’s opinion as to the value of the trailer while she inhabited it, the value of the trailer in the condition it was purchased, and the amount plaintiff paid in excess of the trailer’s worth. In response to a question concerning the fair market value of the trailer at the time it burned, plaintiff indicated that the value was “[a]bout half of what I was supposed to pay for it.” The court instructed the jury to disregard this answer. We disagree with defendant’s argument that plaintiff was not a competent witness regarding the value of her trailer. A witness may give his opinion as to the value of specific personal property if he has obtained his knowledge of value from experience, information, and observation. The witness need not be an expert; it is sufficient that he is familiar with the thing upon which he places a value and has the knowledge and experience necessary to enable him to intelligently value it. 1 Stansbury, North Carolina Evidence § 128 (Brandis rev. 1973). State v. Revelle, 301 N.C. 153, 160, 270 S.E. 2d 476, 480 (1980). In the -case sub judice, plaintiff’s testimony reveals that she lived in *554the trailer at issue for three years and that she had previously purchased another trailer from defendant. This evidence is sufficient to show that plaintiff possessed the familiarity, knowledge and experience to testify about the trailer’s value. The trial court denied plaintiff’s testimony on the erroneous basis that such evidence of value would have to be given by “a realtor specialist or somebody in that field.” Defendant argues in its brief that regardless of plaintiff’s qualifications to answer questions concerning the value of the trailer, she failed to place her answers in the record for purposes of review. Defendant emphasizes that no prejudice has been shown by the court’s action. In Currence v. Hardin, 296 N.C. 95, 249 S.E. 2d 387 (1978), the Court was confronted with this issue and came to the following conclusion: [W]e . . . hold that, whether an objection be to the admissibility of testimony or to the competency of a witness to give that, or any, testimony, the significance of the excluded evidence must be made to appear in the record if the matter is to be heard on review. Unless the significance of the evidence is obvious from the record, counsel offering the evidence must make a specific offer of what he expects to prove by the answer of the witness. Id. at 99-100, 249 S.E. 2d at 390. The second sentence quoted from Currence is dispositive of the question before us. At trial plaintiff attempted to show how much the value of the trailer as promised had been diminished by the defects in the trailer. The significance of this testimony, in determining damages caused by the breach of defendant’s express warranty, clearly did not depend upon the exact numerical answers plaintiff would have given. It is obvious from her complaint that she would have testified that the trailer’s value as delivered was less than the value of the trailer as promised. In light of the trial court’s erroneous exclusion of this testimony regarding the value of the trailer, the order allowing defendant’s motion for directed verdict upon failure of plaintiff to show damages must be reversed. When a defendant moves for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiffs evidence, the trial judge must determine whether the evidence when considered in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and when given the benefit of *555every reasonable inference to be drawn therefrom, is significant to withstand defendant’s motion. Beal v. Supply Co., 36 N.C. App. 505, 244 S.E. 2d 463 (1978). Plaintiffs testimony, including that pertaining to the trailer’s value, constitutes sufficient evidence of an action for breach of an express warranty under the Retail Installment Sales Act and of damages caused by the breach. As to plaintiffs first and third claims for relief, the trial court’s directed verdict and dismissal against plaintiff is affirmed. The directed verdict and dismissal in regards to plaintiffs second claim for relief is reversed. In light of this holding, we deem it unnecessary to discuss plaintiffs fourth assignment of error. The cause is remanded to the District Court of Forsyth County for a new trial on plaintiffs second claim for relief. Reversed in part; affirmed in part. Chief Judge MORRIS concurs. Judge VAUGHN concurs in part and dissents in part. (Judge VAUGHN’S concurring and dissenting opinion is reported at page 816.)   *816Judge VAUGHN concurring in part and dissenting in part to the decision in Simmons v. C. W. Myers Trading Post which begins on page 549. I agree that it was error to exclude plaintiffs testimony as to value. I respectfully disagree and dissent from that portion of the opinion holding that defendant’s alleged failure to make the repair is a violation of G.S. 25A-20, so as to trigger a treble damage claim under G.S. 25A-44(4). The agreement does not alter the terms of any express warranty. The only warranty in the contract is, in substance, as follows. The property is leased “as is,” except that defendant will make the following repairs: “fix faucet, thermostat, bath door, 2 glass in windows, washing machine, h.w. heater, cabinet doors, floors, fix bottom refrigerator, stove needs top. broken window in front bedroom, put caps over vents in back of front bedroom.” Plaintiff alleges the repairs were not made. Defendant contends they were all made. A breach of the contract to make the repairs is not an unfair trade practice under G.S. 25A-44. Plaintiff is only entitled to recover her damages, if any, flowing from that alleged breach. \n",
      " 1. Landlord and Tenant § 8.1— plaintiffs claim not covered by Residential Rental Agreements act Plaintiffs claim for relief based upon an alleged breach of the Residential Rental Agreements act by defendant was invalid since the act did not become effective until 1 October 1977 and the written agreement between plaintiff and defendant was signed one year prior to that date. 2. Consumer Credit § 1— Retail Installment Sales Act — lease with option to purchase trailer — consumer credit sale An agreement between the parties, entitled “Lease with Option to Purchase Trailer,” constituted a consumer credit sale under North Carolina’s Retail Installment Sales Act. G.S. § 25A-2(b). 3. Uniform Commercial Code § 26— damages for breach of warranty Under G.S. § 25-2-714(2), damages for defendant’s violation of its express warranty to repair a trailer leased to plaintiff is the total payments made by plaintiff over the total value of the trailer as warranted since plaintiff had not made the total payments required to exercise her option to buy the trailer. If the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, she would be entitled to treble damages. G.S. § 25A-44(4). 4. Evidence § 45— plaintiff’s opinion as to value of property —erroneously excluded In an action concerning violation of express warranty to repair a trailer sold by defendant to plaintiff, the trial court erred in excluding plaintiff’s opinion as to the value of the trailer while she inhabited it, the value of the trailer in the condition it was purchased, and the amount plaintiff paid in excess of *550the trailer’s worth since the evidence was sufficient to show that plaintiff possessed the familiarity, knowledge and experience to testify about the trailer’s value. Judge Vaughn concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n",

      " 1. Rape § 24— In order for a conviction under G. S., 14-22, there must be an assault by a male upon a female with intent to commit rape, which felonious intent is the intent to gratify his passion upon her at ail events against her will and notwithstanding any resistance she may make. ' 2. Same— Felonious intent is alone insufficient to constitute the offense defined by G. S., 14-22, and therefore immoral advances cannot constitute the offense until they reach the point where they are offensive to the woman and constitute an assault. 3. Rape § 25— In a prosecution for assault with intent to commit rape, an instruction which fully explains the element of felonious intent, and instructs the jury that defendant would be guilty if he laid his hands on prosecutrix with such intent,' must be held for reversible error for failing to charge upon the essential element of assault, since if defendant’s advances were made with the consent of prosecutrix, defendant would not be guilty of the offense. 4. Criminal Raw § 81c (2) — A charge which contains both a correct and incorrect instruction upon a material point must be held for reversible error.\n",
      "  Barnhill, J. The court in its charge clearly defined an assault and instructed the jury: “It may be a simple assault, as where one man strikes another with his hand, shoves him in anger or hits him with his fist. It may be an assault with intent to commit rape. The element of that offense is, that there must be an assault, and there must be an intent on the part of the assailant to have intercourse with.a female by force and in spite of any resistance she might make.” It then charged the jury further as follows : “If a man lays his hands on a ivoman and when he does so he intends to have intercourse with her, in spite of all resistance she may make, against her will, then that is an assault with intent to commit rape. A person may be guilty of an assault with intent to commit rape at any time he takes hold of. a woman, lays his hands on her, and when he does so intends to have intercourse with her by force and against her will, in spite of all resistance she may make. He may change his mind, her resistance might be more than he anticipates; he might be frightened away; but if at any time he took hold of her, laid his hands on her, and when he did so he intended to have intercourse with her by force, against her will and in spite of all resistance she might make, then the crime of assault with intent to commit rape would have been accomplished.” (Italics supplied.) Thus the court in its amplification of the definition given fully explained the intent which is an intrinsic part of the assault, but it inadvertently disregarded the essential element of unlawfulness, rudeness or violence which makes the taking hold of a female an assault. The instruction makes the mere touching of the prosecutrix, without regard to her consent, sufficient if the defendant at the time intended to ravish in the event it became necessary to do so to accomplish his purpose. The defendant admits that he put his hands upon the prosecutrix and that he intended to have carnal knowledge of her. He insists it was with her full consent and approval. *634Under the charge thus given this consent on her part is immaterial. If he intended to press his attentions to the point of sexual gratification by seduction, if possible, by force if necessary, and with that intent laid his hands upon her with her full consent and approval he would be guilty. This is not the law. An assault is the essence of the crime. G. S., 14-22. The offense is not “an attempt to commit rape” but “an assault with intent to commit” the felony. So to convict, the State must prove (1) an assault by a male upon a female (2) with intent to commit rape, and the felonious intent is the intent to gratify his passion on the person of the woman at all events against her will and notwithstanding any resistance she may make. S. v. Hewett, 158 N. C., 627, 74 S. E., 356; S. v. Adams, 214 N. C., 501, 199 S. E., 716; S. v. Jones, 222 N. C., 37, 21 S. E. (2d), 812. The felonious intent alone is not sufficient; nor is a felonious intent accompanied by attentions acceptable to the woman. Hence his advances, however immoral, did not constitute an assault until they reached a point they were offensive to her. Thus the explanation fails to explain. Instead it tends to confuse. That the court had theretofore correctly defined the offense does not cure the error. When there are conflicting instructions to the jury upon a material point, the one correct and the other incorrect, a new trial must be granted. We may not assume that the jurors possessed such discriminating knowledge of the law as would enable them to disregard the erroneous and to accept the correct statement of the law as their guide. We must assume instead that the jury in coming to a verdict, was influenced by that part of the charge that was incorrect. S. v. Mosley, 213 N. C., 304, 195 S. E., 830; Templeton v. Kelley, 217 N. C., 164, 7 S. E. (2d), 380; S. v. Starnes, 220 N. C., 384, 17 S. E. (2d), 346, and cited authorities; S. v. Walsh, 224 N. C., 218, 29 S. E. (2d), 743. The error in the charge entitles defendant to a new trial and it is so ordered. New trial. \n"
